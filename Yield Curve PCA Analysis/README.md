Yield Curve PCA Model for Fixed Income Trading Desks

Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world PCA-based yield curve analysis tool tailored for FIC trading desk practice, inspired by institutional workflows at Commonwealth Bank and BNP Paribas. The model extracts level, slope, and curvature factors from Australian government bond ETFs to support macro rate monitoring, bond positioning, and risk diagnostics.

Key Features
1) Real-world assets: Uses ASX-listed ETFs GOVT.AX, VGB.AX, and ILB.AX to proxy the term structure.

2) PCA decomposition: Captures the first three principal components—interpreted as level, slope, and curvature.

3) Daily factor projection: Generates PC1–PC3 values for 120+ trading days, enabling time-series insights.

4) Scalable pipeline: Designed using scikit-learn pipeline structure for reusability and scalability.

5) CQF-aligned quant skills: Demonstrates hands-on PCA modelling and diagnostics—aligning with CBA’s quant research and trading framework.
